# ComBat_Python
ComBat is an R package for removing batch effects from data. <br>
This is a python version that matches the output from the ComBat function in SVA (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sva.html). <br>
This code is completely copied from the ComBat function in that package.<br>
<br>
The main advantage of this script is the ability of extract the trained estimators from 1 dataset and apply it to a new data set.<br>
This ability allows the possibility of using ComBat in Cross Validation schemes.<br>
<br>
The script is a slightly modified version of the ComBat pacakge in Python, click the link below to access the original package:<br>
